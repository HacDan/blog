I have a problem with staying motivated. As with most people I like the idea of starting new projects, but the *newness* tends to ween after a little while and well... the project gets boring. While I'm not there yet with any of my current projects, I know I will get there sooner rather than later. Because of this, I'm deciding to commit to [#100daysofcode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

I don't think I'll blog about every day that I complete of this challenge, but I do plan on posting updates from time-to-time regarding this challenge. This is probably the worst time of year for me to commit to something like this, but ya know what? Who cares. I need to commit to something and stick with it, and when it comes to barrier of entry, I'd say this is more than doable and quite easy to boot!

The plan is to work on re-learning Android development as I mentioned a few days ago. A lot has changed since I created that first published app, so I'm going to dive head first into it. Again, you'll be able to track my progress on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hacdan/).

I plan to blog every 10 days about this, but I'm not committing to that, as my focus will be entirely on coding for 1 hour a day on Android. If, for whatever reason, Android development just isn't working out for me, I do plan to continue the challenge working on a Go project that I've been working on off and on for over a year and it could use some love, haha!

Anyway, check out 100 days of code. It's an interesting challenge for anyone. And I do mean anyone. From the senior dev to someone who's never worked with code before. I'm a firm believer that everyone can benefit from being able to program. I'm also a firm believer that not everyone should be a full time software developer, but being able to automate certain aspects of your job is always a good thing!

Until next time!
